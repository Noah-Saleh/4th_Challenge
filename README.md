# 4th_Challenge -- Risk-Return Analysis

## Summary of Purpose

This is not a program. 
This is just a risk-return analysis of the following 4 funds based on daily data from 2014 to 2020:  

1. Soros Fund Management LLC
2. Paulson & Co. INC.
3. Tiger Global Management LLC
4. Berkshire Hathaway INC.

I analyzed 5 main aspects of each fund:  
1. Performance
2. Volatility
3. Risk
4. Risk vs. Return
5. Influence from S&P 500

I concluded that Tiger Global Management LLC was the best option of the 4 for a retirement fund  
because of its great return per unit risk & because of its stability relative to the broader market (S&P 500).

To reach this conclusion, I utilized annualized Sharpe ratios and 60-day rolling betas, among other things.
